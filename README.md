#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting a user's needs requires understanding their goals, challenges, and desired outcomes.  By breaking these down into actionable items, I can design and 
develop features that can meet their expectations.  Creating user stories helps simplify this process by providing a clear, structured, goal-driven approach.  Because each user
story focuses on a specific need, I can implement features incrementally and ensure they meet the objectives.  

#How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs, I follow an iterative approach that focuses on small, functional increments.  This allows for continuous feedback and improvement, ensuring the final product meets
user needs effectively.  Agile processes such as sprint planning, backlog prioritization, and daily standups help structure work and maintain progress.  
I would aim to incorporate retrospectives in future work to enable continuous improvement.  

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I think a good team member is someone who actively contributes to the team, communicates effectively, and supports the team's goals.  I would want to work with someone 
who collaborates and respects their team members.  In Agile teams, this could mean participating in discussions, providing feedback, and being transparent around what is 
working and what is not working.
